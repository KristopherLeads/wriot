# The wriot Archive
As a writer and developer, I have created content across the internet on a wide variety of topics. As the internet is still somewhat ephemeral, it made sense to me to start collecting this material into a central location. To that end, I am undertaking the arduous task of archiving content onto this public repo for posterity. As this archive grows, I imagine I'll need a more significant frontend to navigate the contents - for now, I'm simply going to have everything stored by publishing location within sub-folders according to date.

Please feel free to email me via my [website](https://www.kristophermsandoval.com/scheduling) if you'd like to give some feedback!
