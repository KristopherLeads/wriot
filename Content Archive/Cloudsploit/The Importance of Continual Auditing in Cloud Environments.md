# The Importance of Continual Auditing in Cloud Environments

The concept of “the cloud” is an amazingly powerful and novel solution for many providers and users. The idea of shifting from physical infrastructure to the digital space is an attractive one, especially when consideration is given to the impact of such a migration in terms of economy, ease of access, and ease of use. Due to this alluring nature, many organizations have rushed to adopt cloud-based solutions in recent years, and have garnered a large amount of success.

There is a problem with this, however - in the mad rush to the latest and greatest, some significant downsides are often overlooked. These issues, while relatively minor in nature and often easily mitigated, can grow quickly out of control, magnifying and compounding other internal security faults, procedural issues, and basic foundational inequities. If left unaddressed, these downsides can lead a minor script issue or gateway configuration error out of the realm of “minor issue” and into the realm of “major crisis”.

In this piece, we’re going to talk about some of these issues, and the unique solutions that can be applied for mitigative purposes. We’ll also look at where these issues came from, and the fundamental nature of the cloud environment.

## What’s The Problem?

Before we dive into any specific problems that need to be addressed, it helps to take a look at the nature of cloud computing, and the architectural style it was designed to replace.

Traditional environments are, in many ways, surprisingly limited. It’s quite impressive, when looking at the ecosystem from afar, that so many amazing, progressive, and forward thinking solutions have sprung out of systems rooted in legacy technology, slow configuration propagation, and (often) antiquated architecture.

That’s not to say every traditional environment is so limited - it’s more to say that the nature of traditional environments has their own sets of limitations. Hardware needs time to distribute solutions, the slowest server on a network will determine the resultant speed of any communication it handles (regardless of the origination speed), and generally speaking, implementing a new solution, technology, or process is an arduous process rather than an agile one.

That’s not to say all traditional environments suffer from all of these issues - many solutions have been proposed for the intrinsic problems with physically dependent networks, but for each solution comes a range of caveats. This is just as true with cloud computing as with any other solution that has been proposed.

## Drowning in a Sea of Settings

One base issue with the advent of cloud computing is the complete freedom it provides. While this sounds like a benefit - after all, freedom is a good thing, right? - the complete freedom to access and manipulate any setting under the sun presents a new range of issues that might not be present in some traditional networks.

Whereas a traditional network with traditional network appliances might distribute vendor specific solutions and mandates to aid in vendor compliance, these types of strictures aren’t exactly applied in the cloud space due to the virtualized nature of the technology. And while this means greater freedom, it also means that many of the base reasoning for these compliance measures are ignored for the sake of “up and running now”.

As part of this sea change in how compliance is handled, there are more settings available to the lay operator than in traditional networks. While traditional networks might hand over only the settings that need to be configured and adjust for compliance, security policies, and authority policies from the centralized authority on a network, cloud services offer a “blank slate”.

This is a great thing - and also a terrible thing, as the availability of hundreds or thousands of settings with an almost infinite amount of combinations in a completely free landscape (by default) is often handled about as well as could be expected.

## Settings Drift - The Ultimate Case of Set and Forget?

One could argue that this is only a good thing thus far - that the breadth of settings is just as much an issue in some environments, and further, there’s very little difference between the traditional environment and the cloud. We’re missing a piece of the puzzle here that makes that argument fall flat on its face - agility.

Cloud environments are incredibly agile. A good way to liken traditional environments to cloud environments is to compare a horse to a car - on the surface, both are transportation methods following the same basic physical laws, but their potential for damage through operation is staggeringly different.

Whereas a change in a traditional network might be caught during the week leading up to its deploy during initial testing and configuration planning, the appeal of cloud computing often leads to solutions being implemented within hours of conception.

While this is great from a development viewpoint, it often has the effect of depressing the system as a whole. As user profiles are promoted beyond what would typically be allowed, IPs are added to whitelists, and applications configured on the fly, the security policies and configurations start to twist into a form nearly unrecognizable compared to their initial construction.

To harken back to our “horse and buggy” comparison, the difference between traditional and cloud computing is the difference between galloping and driving a car 100km/h down the highway - yes, they are identical in function (that is, getting from one place to another), but slightly oversteering on a horse at that speed is going to have far different - and less destructive - results than a similar action in a Ferrari.

## The Importance of Continual Auditing

What’s the solution then? Are we meant to see these issues inherent in the cloud architecture and return to the ways of old?

Absolutely not. What we’re advocating for is not regression; rather, we are arguing for attention. Continual auditing, that is the process of consistently verifying user policies, security configurations, and changes to the ecosystem, is vitally important and critical to the success of any environment - this is doubly so for cloud computing.

Just as you would need to in a race car going 100km/h down the highway, a provider needs to pay attention to all movements and changes, no matter how small, if they are to effectively function. In a cloud system, providers must follow suit and implement a tool for continual change monitoring. This tool should use a snapshot approach, taking a baseline measure and then alerting providers to changes outside of a specified policy. More to the point, such a solution should provide steps to remediate the risk that has been introduced.

## CloudSploit

One such solution is CloudSploit. CloudSploit is a security and configuration scanner that integrates into cloud environments, detecting hundreds of threats in your AWS account. Open security groups, misconfigured VPCs, best practices for security policies, and configuration auditing are all handled to ensure your infrastructure performs as intended, and at the level expected.
