# Cloudsploit and Best Practices - How Security Affects Development and Product
Often, security is treated as a secondary consideration - it’s something handled once the core service is developed. This is entirely backwards, and is the result of simply not understanding the value behind security at large. Adopting best practices in the security realm can have marked impacts on the health of your development, the value of your product, and the market value of your efforts.

In this article, we’re going to look at security best practices, and how they affect both development and product. We’ll look at how security is something that should be adopted early, not as a second thought - more specifically, we’ll also look at how security can be a leveraging tool to deliver even greater value over time.

## Security by Design

One of the main objections to integrating security from a business perspective is the cost. After all, adding security after the fact can be a heavy expense to bear, especially for startups and those just developing a new product. The reality though is that much of this cost comes from the expense of retrofit, not from first adoption.

More to the point, adopting security by design from the first stages of development is also quite a bit more effective. Trying to apply a security scheme after the fact means that you’re working in a scheme into a fundamentally insecure code base - you’re spending far more than you should to get a far worse product.

For this reason, security should be adopted early on as a fundamental design paradigm.

## Free Your Developers

While that is a good argument for early implementation, some may feel that focusing heavily on security ties up developer resources. Yes, that is true - but these resources can be released dramatically if the proper tooling is utilized.

Auditing best practices can consume ridiculous resources unless automated solutions are leveraged properly. Ongoing automated resource management, testing, and auditing can make huge gains in time and efficiency.

More to the point, automated solutions negate much of the developer investment in security. Developers don’t just need to be concerned about monetary cost, but cost in codebase as well - by abstracting and ensuring security is handled discreetly within the code itself, the complexities of external security systems are nullified.

## Ensuring Compliance in Base Form

Of course, security is not just a matter of code. Compliance is a major element for many organizations, especially those handling financial data. Ensuring compliance within the entire code base means that risks to the entire organization can be effectively mitigated.

This is a major source of possible threat - compliance issues can result in major losses and exposure of resources, so adopting a scheme that bakes in compliance is not only a good idea, it’s a desperately needed investment.

As part of this, such auditing through security processing can help in assessing risk,planning for mitigation and remediation, and tracking code changes over time to ensure continued compliance.

## Customer Protections

There’s also the intrinsic value of providing protection to your customers. Customer trust is the core value of any organization on the market, and as such, treating security as a second thought only serves to devalue your customers and their data. On the other hand, investing heavily in security and ensuring that you are compliant is perhaps one of the best things you can do from a brand perspective and value proposition.

## Cloudsploit

Cloudsploit is a wonderful solution that offers many features that can help you treat security as a core development concept. Continual auditing, ongoing security reviews, and automated processing means that your code base is made more secure, and it’s kept that way.

One of the biggest areas of concern for modern cloud services is configuration. With thousands of different options and configurations, even a small mismanaged setting can cause dramatic impact on the entire health of the codebase and the organization. Cloudsploit audits these services effectively and efficiently, finding major weak points in your organization. These points include:

* Publicly exposed servers;
* Unencrypted or unsecured data storage and server access;
* Lack of least privilege policies which prevent escalation and cross-group attacks;
* Poor passwords or lack of multifactor authentication;
* Misconfigured server settings, backup policies, and restore methods.

Any organization can benefit from Cloudsploit - it makes the adoption of security as a fundamental core process that much easier and effective.
